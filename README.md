Signal/Collect [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/uzh/signal-collect/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/uzh/signal-collect/latest)
========================================================================================================================

Signal/Collect is a framework for computations on large graphs. The model allows to concisely express many iterated and data-flow algorithms, while the framework parallelizes and distributes the computation.

This repository contains pre-release snapshots of the distributed 2.0 version.

How to Compile the Project
--------------------------
Ensure Java 7 is available on the system, verify with "java -version" on the command line.

Install SBT: http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html

Go to the project folder and start SBT on the command line. The output should end with:
"[info] Set current project to signal-collect (in build file:XYZ/signal-collect/)"

To generate a .jar file with dependencies, use the "assembly" command on the SBT prompt.

To generate an Eclipse project, use the "eclipse" command on the SBT prompt.


How to Develop in Eclipse
-------------------------
Generate an Eclipse project as described above.

Install the Typesafe IDE for Scala 2.10.1 from: http://www.typesafe.com/stack/downloads/scala-ide

Ensure that Eclipse uses the Java 7 library and JVM: Preferences → Java → Installed JREs → JRE/JDK 7 should be installed and selected.

Open the Scala project that was generated by SBT with: File → Import... → General → Existing Projects into Workspace → select "signal-collect" folder
